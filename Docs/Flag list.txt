CP = location of java macros
SIMPATH = Folder to run sims from
STARLOC = Location of starccm executable
PODKEY = PoD key 
LICPATH = 1999@flex.cd-adapco.com; 
MACRO = macro to run. generally macroController
CLUSTER = cluster to submit job to (scholar, gpu, or long)
CLUMPED = setting to true puts every sim in SIMPATH in a single job. false gives each sim its own job
PROCS = total procs to use
JOBS_IN_PARALLEL = if clumped is enabled, this will try to run multiple jobs on the same node. This number is how many jobs will be run across all available nodes combined. 
FAN = set to true if you want a fan model for the radiator. Otherwise false. 
yaw = yaw angle in degrees
sideslip = sideslip angle in degrees
cornering = cornering radius for cornering sim (unused for straight line, but still specify, meters)
steering = tyre slip change angle in degrees
frh = front ride height change in inches
rrh = rear ride height change in inches. 
freestream = freestream in m/s
maxSteps = total steps to run
preprocess = true to surface wrap and mesh. false to skip
process = true to run solver. false to skip
postprocess = true to generate post processed data. false to skip
windTunnel = setting to true sets ground velocity and wheel rotations to zero
DES = setting to true runs a transient DES sim (been a while since i checked if it works)
WALLTIME = length of job in minutes. This is OPTIONAL.
