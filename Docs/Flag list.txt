CP = location of java macros;
SIMPATH = Folder to run sims from;
STARLOC = Location of starccm executable;
PODKEY = PoD key;
LICPATH = license path;
MACRO = macro to run. generally MacroController;
CLUSTER = cluster to submit job to (scholar, gpu, or long);
SUB_CLUSTER = A or B depending on which subcluster. theoretically you could also use G if you want a GPU node on scholar instead of gpu for some reason;
CLUMPED = false if every sim in SIMPATH gets its own job, true if every sim in SIMPATH runs serially on one job;
NODES = how many nodes do you want;
CONV_SC = true if you want to use convergence checker, false if not;
yaw = yaw angle in degrees;
sideslip = sideslip angle in degrees;
cornering = cornering radius for cornering sim (unused for straight line, but still specify, meters);
steering = tyre slip change angle in degrees;
frh = front ride height change in inches;
rrh = rear ride height change in inches;
roll = roll angle in degrees;
freestream = freestream in m/s;
FAN = true if you want fans enabled, false if you want them disabled;
preprocess = true to surface wrap and mesh. false to skip;
process = true to generate post processed data. false to skip;
postprocess = true to generate post processed data. false to skip;
windTunnel = setting to true sets ground velocity and wheel rotations to zero;
DES = setting to true runs a transient DES sim (been a while since i checked if it works);
