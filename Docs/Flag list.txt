NEW Flaglist Setup:
* SIMPATH - Location of your simulation folder
* STARLOC - Location of your star installation
* CP - Classpath. This is the working directory for the java macros.
* PODKEY - Podkey
* LICPATH - pick a license server. 1999@dock.ecn.purdue.edu for a power session. 1999@flex.cd-adapco.com for a PoD
* MACRO - Name of the macro to run (99% of the time it’ll be macroController)
* CLUSTER - sets the cluster to use (scholar, long)
* WALLTIME - maximum wall time (4:00:00 for scholar, 72:00:00 for long)
* yaw - Yaw angle in degrees.
* freestream - set freestream velocity in m/s
* maxSteps - Maximum steps for stopping criteria. Defaults to 1100
* preprocess - Wraps and meshes the geometery (true or false)
* process - Runs the sim and exports reports (true or false)
* postprocess - Exports reports and runs scenes (true or false)
* windTunnel - Set it to true to stop wheel rotation and ground travel. false for typical real-world/rolling-road
* DES - set to true for DES
 
OLD Flaglist Setup:
* frh - Sets front ride height (inches delta from baseline)
* rrh - Sets rear ride height (inches delta from baseline)
* newName - Sets new file name (must end with .sim) (folderBuilder.py sets this for you)
* rws - Enter 1 if you want to sweep through rear wing scenes. 0 if not. 
* fws - Front wing scenes. See above
* uts - Undertray scenes. See above
* cs - Car scenes. See above
* ps - Plot scenes. See above
* sceneMultiplier - Multiplies scene dimension steps by the input. Use 1 to use default (very fine)
* yaw - Yaw angle in degrees. 
* roll - Roll angle in degrees.
* domainSet - "true" or "false". True sets the domain to be full-car and false sets it to half-car. Only works if geometryManip is also set to true
* freestream - set freestream velocity in m/s
* maxSteps - Maximum steps for stopping criteria. Defaults to 1100
* surfaceWrap - Runs surface wrapper, subtract, regions. 
* autoMesh - Runs automesh, genReports, meshRepair
* LIC - Set to true for LIC scenes to be exported with the post proc
* process - Runs the sim and exports reports
* postprocess - Exports reports and runs scenes
* windTunnel - Set it to true to stop wheel rotation and ground travel. false for typical real-world/rolling-road
* geometryManip - Set to true to run domainSet, roll, yaw, ride height macros. 
* CLUSTER - sets the cluster to use (scholar, long)
* PROCS - number of processors to use. 1 automatically changes the command to serial. 
* CLUMP - Tells the python scheduler whether to bundle all the sims into a single job, or submit a separate job for each sim
* WALLTIME - maximum wall time (4:00:00 for scholar, 72:00:00 for long)
* PODKEY - Podkey
* STARLOC - Location of your star installation
* SIMPATH - Location of your simulation folder
* MACRO - Name of the macro to run (99% of the time it’ll be macroController)
* KW - set to true for kw sim
* SA - set to true for SA sim
* DES - set to true for DES
* clearMesh - set to true to clear mesh prior to kill.java
* CP - Classpath. This is the working directory for the java macros. 
* FILENAME - file name for your simulation file (don’t need this for folderBuilder.py, since it picks files out from a folder inputted in the Python script)
* LICPATH - pick a license server. 1999@dock.ecn.purdue.edu for a power session. 1999@flex.cd-adapco.com for a PoD
